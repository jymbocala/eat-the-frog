### **R1 - Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.**

I am developing this app to address the common issue of procrastination, a significant obstacle to productivity. The primary challenge many individuals face is the lack of prioritization and feeling overwhelmed by numerous tasks. This app is inspired by Brian Tracy's philosophy outlined in his book "Eat That Frog!", the app aims to guide users in tackling their most challenging task each day, using the metaphor of "eating a frog" as a representation of overcoming difficulties.

Distinct from traditional to-do apps, this app's focus is on cultivating the habit of completing the most challenging task daily. To emphasize this, users are restricted to creating only one crucial task per day. Additionally, the app incorporates social interaction features, allowing users to follow each other and includes gamification elements to enhance user engagement. The intent is to create a supportive and motivating environment, encouraging users to consistently confront and conquer their daily challenges.
